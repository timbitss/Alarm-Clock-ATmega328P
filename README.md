# Personalized Alarm Clock Using ATmega328P 

I explored concepts in electronics such as timers, interrupts, programmable flash memory, PWM, filters, PIR motion sensors, and button debouncing using software to create a personal alarm clock. I implemented simple melodies using PWM and the ATmega's built-in flash memory as well as a snooze setting enabled through motion detection.
