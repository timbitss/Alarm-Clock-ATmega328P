# Personalized Alarm Clock Using ATmega328P 

  I explored key concepts in electronics such as timers, interrupts, programmable flash memory, PWM, DPCM, PIR motion sensors, and button debouncing using software to create a personalized alarm clock. I implemented a snooze alarm that is enabled through motion detection and audio that can play back WAV files.
